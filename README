I've forked this project from [django-cart]() on Google Code. It seems like 
it was initially started by Eric Woudenberg and then taken over by
Marc Garcia. It seems like the project was never really completed. Some 
methods didn't do anything, updates haven't been made in a while, etc. It's
licensed under the GPL which wouldn't have been my preference but I don't 
think there's a whole lot I could do there.

I have made a few changes. I implemented the update method for the cart. I 
don't know if this is the best way of doing it but so far it works for my 
purposes to I welcome any additions or modifications. The biggest change is 
probably the integration of [python-money](). I think currency calculation is 
beyond the scope of a shopping cart app and is probably best handled by 
a separately maintained module. Unfortunately, it looks like python-money also
has fallen into disuse so if you're going to use this, be prepared to have to 
install this module as well. Also, there's an important patch I attached to 
an [open issue]() that you will want to apply if you're using a version of 
Django released in the last year (you probably are).
