Django-cart is a lightweight pluggable cart app meant for integration with a 
Django based e-commerce solution. [Satchmo][] is out there and apparently pretty
mature, but I didn't want to deal with maintaining all the required 
dependencies and needed more flexibility.

I've forked this project from [django-cart][] on Google Code. It seems like 
it was initially started by Eric Woudenberg and then taken over by
[Marc Garcia][]. The project had seemed to been abandoned so I contacted Marc
and asked him if I could fork the project and relicense. He agreed, so I've
released my updated version of django-cart on GitHub which adds update 
functionality. I would have just hacked on the Google Code version but I 
never bothered to learn svn and git just makes too much sense. Apparently 
using git with Google Code is [more than doable][doable] but I'm proud of 
myself for using any SCM and I don't need to add more complications to that. 

As per my discussion with Marc, this code is now licensed under the MIT License.
