# django-cart

Django-cart is a small, focused shopping cart meant to be integrated into 
custom django e-commerce solutions. If you're looking for something more
robust, take a look at Satchmo; however, note that Satchmo has a pretty steep
learning curve, and, in my opinion, isn't very Django-like.

django-cart currently works pretty well but requires you to write 
implementation views for each project. I'd like to eventually have built-in
view that would allow you to simply route URLs to this pluggable and have
it automagically update the cart tables in your project's database. I don't 
have the Django chops to pull that off right now, so if anyone is interested 
in helping, I'd welcome any contributions.
